Mosquitoes are insects of interest in regards to ecology, as well as public health. In the United States, the incidence of mosquito-borne diseases in humans is highly variable across years (Rosenberg et al. 2018). Investigating population trends over space and time can lead to a better understanding of these patterns in incidence. Further, research in this area can help illuminate changes in both ecological health of a region, as well as guide public health decisions regarding species control of problem mosquitoes.

<h3>Data Source

<font size = "4">
The data used in this project was mosquito trapping data from the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON). More information can be found in the data tab.

<h3>Questions</h3>

<font size = "4">
1. How does overall mosquito biomass and species richness change over the course of the year, and how does that vary across US regions? (Spatial and Seasonal Trends)  
</br>
2. How do the biomass of mosquitoes collected and number of mosquitoes identified by genus nationwide vary by year? (Annual Trends)  
</br>
3. How abundant are medically important mosquitoes throughout the US, and how prevalent are mosquito-borne pathogens? (Pathogen Vectors)  
</br>
4. At what precision were mosquitoes identified and how does that vary in time and space? (Taxonomic Precision)  
</font>

<h3>Analysis Approach</h3>

<font size = "4">
- Download NEON mosquito CO2 trapping data and pathogen ID data from the NEON API.  
- Download shapefile of NEON domains from NEON website.  
- Calculate variables of interest in mosquito data.  
- Summarize variables by domain, month, year depending on question.  
- Join summary data with domain polygon shapefile.  
- Draw maps and figures displaying trends.  
</font>

<h3>Summary of Results</h3>

<font size = "4">
1. Spatial and Seasonal Trends:   
- Biomass is highest in the Great Lakes and Tundra Domains, with seasonal peaks in July.  
- Species Richness is highest for the domains in the Southeast US, such as the Southern Plains.  
</br>
2. Annual Trends:  
- Mosquito biomass/hr and genera proportions are fairly consistent over the years.  
</br>
3. Pathogen Vectors:  
- Disease vectors are most common in the Northern Plains Domain, and positive tests for pathogen were most common for the Great Lakes Domain.  
</br>
4. Taxonomic Precision:  
- Many mosquitoes in the Alaskan domains were only IDed to genus, while many mosquitoes in the Northeast Domain were identified all the way to subspecies.
