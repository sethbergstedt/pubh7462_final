Mosquitoes are insects of interest in regards to ecology, as well as public health. In the United States, the incidence of mosquito-borne diseases in humans is highly variable across years (Rosenberg et al. 2018). Investigating population trends over space and time can lead to a better understanding of these patterns in incidence. Further, research in this area can help illuminate changes in both ecological health of a region, as well as guide public health decisions regarding species control of problem mosquitoes.

<h3>Questions</h3>

<font size = "4">
1. How does overall mosquito biomass and species richness change over the course of the year, and how does that vary across US regions?  
2. How abundant are medically important mosquitoes throughout the US, and how prevalent ar emosquito-borne pathogens?  
3. What are some of the limitations and caveats of the data? For example, do certain locations have trends in reporting?
