Species richness refers to the total number of different mosquito species identified to species in the samples collected from a given domain and/or month.

Notes: The shades of the domains in the map match the lines and points on the seasonal plot. Hover over domains on the map or plot points for more information. Double click on domains in the plot legned to see isolated seasonal trends.
